# Pointing Poker
This is a group project for RSS-School React course.  
The main idea of it - implement its own [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) game. We renamed it and created a unique design.  
More about our work process you may find the presentation.  
There are may be a few games, may be added a few players. For more comfort, you may set timers, autocomplete, and other options. All game process controls by the Dealer. Tasks may be input by using the app, also by file. You may download the results of the game in CSV format
